        You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. <br>
        Each letter has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are <br>
        given 2 parameters instead of 1.<br>
        <br>
        You can not use multiplier "*" operator.<br>
        <br>
        If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 <br>
        (Space counts as a letter).<br>
